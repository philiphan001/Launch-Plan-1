can you pleaes review

I'll help you review your codebase. Let me first take a look at what files are available in your workspace.
I see this is a React project with both frontend and backend components. Let me check the main application files to provide a comprehensive review.
Let me check the main App component and some key files to provide a detailed review.
Let me check the server-side code to understand the backend implementation.
Based on my review of your codebase, here are my observations and recommendations:
Frontend Architecture (App.tsx):
Well-structured React application using TypeScript
Good use of hooks (useState, useEffect) for state management
Proper authentication flow with login, signup, and logout functionality
Smart routing logic based on user authentication status and first-time user status
Backend Structure:
Clean separation of concerns with routes, storage, and database layers
Good use of TypeScript for type safety
Integration with Python for certain calculations (based on the python directory)
Proper database handling with PostgreSQL (pg-storage.ts)
Areas for Improvement:
Authentication:
Consider implementing JWT token refresh mechanism
Add rate limiting for login attempts
Implement password reset functionality
Error Handling:
Add more comprehensive error handling in API calls
Implement a global error boundary component
Add better error messages for users
Performance:
Consider implementing code splitting for routes
Add caching for frequently accessed data
Optimize API calls with proper debouncing/throttling
Testing:
Add more test files for critical components
Implement end-to-end testing
Add unit tests for utility functions
Security Considerations:
Ensure all API endpoints are properly protected
Implement CSRF protection
Add input validation on both client and server side
Consider implementing 2FA for sensitive operations
Code Organization:
Consider moving authentication logic to a separate context provider
Create a dedicated API service layer
Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for all API responses
Documentation:
Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
Create API documentation
Add setup instructions in README
Would you like me to dive deeper into any of these areas or provide specific code examples for implementing any of the suggested improvements?
I am having runtime error issues 

I'll help you investigate the runtime errors. Let me first check the error logs and relevant files to identify the issues.
Let me check the server-side code to see if there are any issues with the API endpoints.
Based on my analysis of your codebase, I've identified several potential runtime issues that could be causing problems:
Authentication Issues:
The /api/auth/me endpoint might be failing silently in the initial auth check
The session configuration might not be properly set up in development
Password comparison is using plain text (not hashed) which could cause security issues
API Response Handling:
Some API calls might be failing due to missing error handling
The response parsing might fail if the server returns non-JSON responses
State Management:
Multiple state updates in quick succession could cause race conditions
The navigation logic might cause infinite redirects in some cases
Here are the specific fixes I recommend:
First, let's improve the error handling in the auth check:
Apply

Let's fix the navigation logic to prevent potential infinite redirects:
Apply
;
Let's improve the server-side error handling:
Apply

Let's add proper password hashing on the server side:
Apply

To implement these changes:
First, install the required dependencies:
Apply
Run
bcrypt
Then, apply the code changes I've suggested above.
Make sure your environment variables are properly set:
Apply
Run
development
Would you like me to help you implement any of these changes or would you like me to investigate any specific runtime errors you're experiencing?
can you also review how the code is handling saved projections and recalling saved projections?  This doesn't work well - if at all.

I'll investigate how the code handles saved projections. Let me check the relevant files and components.
After reviewing the code, I've identified several issues with how saved projections are being handled:
Data Loading Issues:
The code tries to handle both string and object formats for projectionData, which can lead to parsing errors
There's no proper error handling when loading saved projections
The cache-busting mechanism might not be working effectively
State Management Problems:
Multiple state updates are happening independently, which can cause race conditions
The projection data state isn't properly synchronized with other state values
The loading of saved projections doesn't properly reset all related state
Data Consistency Issues:
The schema allows for nullable fields that should be required
There's no validation of the projection data before saving
The projection data structure isn't consistent between saves and loads
Here's how we can fix these issues:
First, let's improve the schema to ensure data consistency:
Apply

Let's improve the projection loading logic:
