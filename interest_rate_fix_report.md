# Personal Loan Interest Rate Bug Fix

## Issue Description

An issue was identified in the financial calculator where personal loan interest rates were incorrectly processed during calculations. Interest rates provided as percentage values (such as 8%) were not being properly converted to decimal form (0.08) before being used in calculations, resulting in effective interest rates that were 100 times higher than intended (800% instead of 8%).

## Root Cause

The issue was located in the `from_input_data` method in `server/python/financial_updated.py`. While retirement contribution and growth rates had conversion logic to handle percentage inputs, the personal loan interest rate lacked this conversion step.

### Bug Location

In `server/python/financial_updated.py`, the `from_input_data` static method was receiving personal loan interest rates as percentage values (such as 8.0 for 8%) but using them directly in calculations that expected decimal values (0.08 for 8%).

## Fix Implementation

The fix adds a conversion step for personal loan interest rates similar to the existing logic for retirement rates:

```python
# Before fix - No conversion for personal loan interest rate
personal_loan_interest_rate_raw = input_data.get('personalLoanInterestRate', DEFAULT_PERSONAL_LOAN_INTEREST_RATE)

# After fix - Adding conversion for personal loan interest rate
personal_loan_interest_rate_raw = input_data.get('personalLoanInterestRate', DEFAULT_PERSONAL_LOAN_INTEREST_RATE)
personal_loan_interest_rate = personal_loan_interest_rate_raw / 100.0 if personal_loan_interest_rate_raw > 1 else personal_loan_interest_rate_raw
```

This conversion ensures that interest rates provided as percentages (values > 1) are divided by 100 to get their decimal equivalents, while already-decimal values (â‰¤ 1) are used directly.

## Verification

The fix was verified using multiple tests:

1. The debug logs now show "Personal Loan Interest Rate: 8.0%" instead of "Personal Loan Interest Rate: 800.0%"
2. A loan payment test shows monthly payments of ~$202 for a $10,000 loan at 8% for 5 years, which is the correct amount
3. Without the fix, personal loans would have accumulated interest at 800% instead of 8%, causing massive debt increase

## Impact

This fix ensures that personal loans created by the financial calculator use the correct interest rate, preventing wildly inaccurate financial projections for users with negative cash flow or emergency fund depletion scenarios where personal loans are automatically created.
